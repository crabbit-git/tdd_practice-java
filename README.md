# Learning Java by Test-Driven Development

I've been learning Java on [Exercism](https://exercism.org) lately. This repository contains my solutions to the exercises I've done so far, or at least the most recent iterations of them; if you want to see my earlier iterations, those are all published over on [my Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/crabbit-git/solutions).

If you're learning Java yourself, especially if you're doing that on Exercism, please don't use this to cheat. Santa's watching. Besides, I'm just learning this myself, so I highly doubt that my solutions will all be optimal anyway.
